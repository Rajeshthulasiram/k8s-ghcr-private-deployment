Project: k8s-ghcr-private-deployment
Summary: Deployed a private container image from GitHub Container Registry into a Kubernetes cluster using imagePullSecrets. Designed secure, namespace-scoped deployments with Docker and GHCR, demonstrating hands-on Kubernetes access control and image lifecycle.


✅ Why k8s-ghcr-private-deployment Adds Real Value to Your CV
🎯 Real-World Relevance
This project reflects what real companies do:
Use private registries (like GitHub Container Registry, ECR, Artifactory)
Enforce secure image pulling with imagePullSecrets
Deploy applications into namespaced Kubernetes clusters
Follow best practices for CI/CD and image lifecycle


👨‍💻 What Experience Level Does This Project Reflect?
🟨 1–2 Years (Intermediate Level)
✅ This project is ideal for someone with:

1–2 years of experience as a Cloud/DevOps/Kubernetes engineer
Intermediate hands-on skills with Kubernetes and Docker
